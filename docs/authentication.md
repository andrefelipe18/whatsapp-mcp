# Authentication

Clients authenticate with an API key or an OAuth access token. The panel
password and internal Evolution token serve separate purposes.

## Client keys

A client using fixed credentials needs exactly one thing: an API key. The key identifies the account and
the WhatsApp instance it is authorised for, so there is no user, no password and
no instance name to configure.

Keys are `wamcp-` followed by 24 alphanumeric characters, around 142 bits of
entropy. Only the SHA-256 digest is stored — SHA-256 rather than bcrypt because
bcrypt's deliberate cost protects a human-chosen password against a dictionary,
and would add roughly 100 ms to every MCP request here while guarding against an
attack that cannot succeed against 142 random bits.

The endpoint has no anonymous mode:

- A credential is accepted only in the `Authorization` header, never in a query
  string, where it would end up in proxy logs and browser history.
- A rejected credential gets a `401` that does not distinguish an unknown key
  from a revoked one.
- Repeated failures are throttled per source address.
- Revocation takes effect immediately, because each request is authenticated on
  its own.

That statelessness is also what makes the endpoint resilient: there is no
session to resume, so a dropped connection costs nothing.

Issue one key per client. That is what lets you revoke the laptop without
knocking the desktop offline, and what makes "last used" mean something.

## OAuth clients

ChatGPT and dots connect through OAuth instead of a fixed API key. Enable
the pre-registered public client following [OAuth setup](oauth.md). The existing
panel login approves access to one selected WhatsApp instance. Codes require
S256 PKCE; access tokens expire after one hour, and rotating refresh tokens
expire with the authorization after 30 days. Replaying a consumed refresh
token revokes the authorization. The panel can revoke the connection immediately.

## The panel account

The administrator password is bcrypt-hashed in PostgreSQL — bcrypt here, because
this *is* a human-chosen password facing a dictionary.

Sessions use signed, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies with concurrency-safe
server-side state. A process restart intentionally invalidates active sessions.

The first visit to a fresh install creates the account. There is no default
password, and you choose the username as well.

Where that form is reachable from the internet it is guarded by `SETUP_TOKEN`:
it opens only at `/setup?token=<value>` and answers 403 without it, throttled
per source address like every other credential check here. The installer
generates the token and prints the finished link. The window it closes is small
but real — an address that exists and has no administrator yet belongs to
whoever asks first.

## The instance token

The panel mints a per-instance Evolution token and stores it in PostgreSQL,
because Evolution resolves the target instance from the key on the request and
accepts no instance parameter. It is an internal secret: never displayed, never
returned by a tool, never sent to an MCP client.

The global `EVOLUTION_API_KEY` is used only for the administrative routes
(`/instance/create`, `/instance/all`, `/instance/delete/{id}`).

## What a key holder can do

An API key grants the full tool surface on the instance it is bound to: reading
every indexed conversation, sending, deleting and editing the account's own
messages, and reacting to anyone's. There is no read-only key today.

Treat a client key as equivalent to handing someone the phone.
